INPUTS:
    1.FIRST LINE OF INPUT: N,Q,M
        WHERE N IS: 1 < N < 10
        TOTAL BUFFER SIZE: 1 < Q < 1000000
        LENGTH OF OPERATION SEQUENCE: 1 < M < 1000000

    2.SECOND LINE OF INPUT: T Integer in One Line
        WHERE T is: 
            for i in t:
                i is priority level of tenant

    3.THIRD LINE OF INPUT: D Integer in One Line
        WHERE D is:
            for t in d:
                t is database size of tenant

    4.FOURTH LINE OF INPUT: 3 * N integer in One Line
        WHERE N triplets is: (Nmin, NBase, NMax)
            They represent the minimum buffer size.
                1.Minimum Buffer size
                2.Base Buffer size
                3.Maximum Buffer size
            Sum of All Nmin value of all tenants are equal to or less than Q
            This means that the total minimum buffer size requested by all tenants is less than or equal to the total buffer size available (Q).
